###  Components Explained

####  Static VAR Compensator (SVC)
A **shunt-connected static var generator/absorber** using thyristor-controlled reactors (TCR) and thyristor-switched capacitors (TSC).  
It adjusts its output to maintain bus voltage stability by absorbing or supplying reactive power.  
SVC provides:
- Quick voltage regulation  
- Improved transient response  
- Lower installation cost compared to STATCOM  

####  Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM)
A **voltage-source converter (VSC)** based shunt-connected compensator.  
It generates controllable reactive power independent of system voltage, offering superior performance in low-voltage conditions.  
STATCOM provides:
- Fast dynamic response  
- Better voltage control  
- Harmonic filtering capability
